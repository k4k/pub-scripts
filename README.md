# My Scripts Repo

This repo contains various scripts I've written. I've tried to keep them
somewhat organized over the years but as things go it can become a bit of a mess
sometimes.

I make no promises about the current working state of anything here. Some of it
is just me playing around, some of it is usable (and in use) in production. I
have tried to denote the former when applicable at the top of the source files
or in the sub-folder README.md files but I'm only human.
