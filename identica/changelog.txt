V.1.1 -- Current release
-------------------------
Key differences from version 1:

	* Significantly shortened the script and improved readability
	* Now using cases to display usage
	* Added break for failure to change USER INFO section (add unique username)
	* Fixed blank password loop

Summary:
	Version 1.0 had some bugs as well as a lot of extra code that was not
	actually needed. Where version 1.0 had two unique sections in which
	the user had to choose how they wanted the script to behave (prompt for
	all fields or hard code all fields except for status). Version 1.1
	combines the ideas of the individual sections in to a single section
	that has a hard coded username (see USER INFO section of script) only.
	The user is prompted for the password after they run the script and
	the status message is taken from whatever is entered in quotes. For
	example, "./identi.ca post "This is a status message."" would prompt
	the user for their password and then post "This is a status message".

To-do:
	* Add support for catching bad authentication
		- right now the program terminates in the same manner even if the
		api returns a authentication failed message.
